# HackEDBeta-MipsClips
For HackED Beta 2023, our team has created a debugger can that read lines of MIPS code from a text file, and then shows how each individual instruction changes registers and memory.
We did not have time to implement branch/jump instructions, but the program can recognize most R-Type and I-Type instructions, including add, or, sll, lw, and sw.
A makefile is included for easy compilation and cleaning of files.
